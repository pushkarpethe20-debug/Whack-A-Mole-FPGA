# Whack-A-Mole-FPGA Game
A Verilog-based real-time game implemented on a Spartan-6 FPGA
This project implements a simple Whack-a-Mole-style game on FPGA hardware using Verilog. The system flashes an LED randomly, and the player responds through corresponding switches to score points.

# Game Description:
1. One LED turns ON randomly.
2. Each LED has an individual switch assigned to it.
3. If the correct switch is toggled while the LED is still ON → score increments.
4. After 30 seconds, the game stops, and the score is displayed on a 7-segment output.

# Tools and Hardware Used
